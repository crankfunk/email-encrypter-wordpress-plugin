# Email Encrypter WordPress Plugin

## Description
A lean WordPress plugin that detects mail addresses in your website code and protects them from harvesting bots through obfuscating and ROT13-encryption.

### Detailed Functionality
The plugin uses a combination of obfuscation and ROT13 encryption to protect email addresses in your website code. On mouseover, a JavaScript function triggers the deobfuscation and decryption to reveal the original email address, ensuring a seamless user experience. To verify the plugin's functionality, inspect the page source before and after mouseover to observe the encryption and decryption process.

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the plugin files from the GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to your WordPress admin panel, then go to `Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin`.
3. Browse and select the downloaded plugin file, then click `Install Now`.
4. After installation, click `Activate Plugin` to start using the Email Encrypter WordPress Plugin.
